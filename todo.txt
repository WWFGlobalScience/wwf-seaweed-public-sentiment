x refactor to use transformer pipeline (wasn't any better than the batching i had before)

x read the paper
    x what method did they use for sentiment analysis?
        x authors did independent, then resolved to consensus if they disagreed
        x there's also an analysis on government public documents they did that seems less relevant, I'll just focus on headlines unless told otherwise

x read about HF sentiment analysis
    x can i add dictionary?
        x not sure how this was used, i think maybe in the gov't documents
    x can i do transfer learning?
        x yes, following this method: https://huggingface.co/blog/sentiment-analysis-python


x what i want to do in my script
    x can i start from a better base?
    x can i make the output prettier (neg, pos, neu)
    x can i do more kinds of training to get a better fit?
    * can i do a k-fold?
    x can i examine the mis-matches better?

x apply result to paper for training
